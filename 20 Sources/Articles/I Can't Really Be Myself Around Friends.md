I'm a quite person but i have strong opinions
however since i avoid conflict i don't like to push those opinions on to someone else
it is difficult to be around people who have judgemental and expresses their opinion in a way that shuts other people down 
the green card situation, that conversation we a little off putting to me because it felt like she was pushing her opinion onto someone else's situation that she had no experience about.

## Highlights
- The problem is when someone is judgmental or expresses their opinion in a way that shuts other people down So it feels less like a conversation but more like a declaration that their view is right and everyone else is wrong When I'm with those kinds of people I find it difficult to be myself because in addition to my tendency to avoid conflict ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg659nq18a3jsq3294nc30aa))
- I actually have quite strong opinions as well I just don't feel the need to push them onto other people ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01kg659t1v714h8hja1xj2p958))
