Writing Routine based on priority 
1. Developing ideas 
    - Start with [Daily working log](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zXRs9fj5BuX5FmrQzPxqWUs) to splat down ideas and lists, to empty your head and figure out what seems most interesting for you to write about today.
    - Write and revising [Evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z5E5QawiXCMbtNtupvxeoEX) 
    - Go through backlog of books and articles that you need to write Evergreen notes for
2. Note taking
    - Writing down other people’s ideas
    - [Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply.](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zB74H9CuWrosEuqve7jZyCo)


“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”
