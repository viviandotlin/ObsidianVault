**In My Life**
<!--What is going on in your life? -->
[[Christina Lam]] is back from Stony Brook
- watched [Zootopia 2](https://letterboxd.com/film/zootopia-2/) ate at [Cho-dang-gol](https://chodanggolnyc.com/)
- ate at [thesandwichboard](https://www.thesandwichboard.co/)
Climbing hard again
- sent a v4/v5 at vital Williamsburg
- extremely sore and shoulder pain, need to warm up better,
- do even more orange climbs before starting the red
	- it's always better to be properly warmed up than get injured again
	- alternate between projecting days and endurance days

**Experiments**
 <!--What new habits, challenges and tools are you trying out to improve your life? -->
 - Working out every morning after drinking coffee.
 - Start time blocking for intentional sessions for
		 - coding, writing, drawing
		 - when you go climbing you can block out such a large chunk of time
		 - during that time you don't have the problem to being constantly distracted by your phone, during your breaks you just look at the climb
