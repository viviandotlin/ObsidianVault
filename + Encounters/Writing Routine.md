Writing Routine  based on priority 
1. Developing ideas 
    - Start with Daily working log to splat down ideas and lists, to empty your head and figure out what seems most interesting for you to write about today.
    - Write and revising Evergreen notes
    - Go through backlog of books and articles that you need to write Evergreen notes for
2. Note taking
    - Writing down other people’s ideas
    - Write about what you read to internalize texts deeply.


“Better note-taking” misses the point; what matters is “better thinking”
