For most of my life, exercise has been **marketed as a weight loss strategy**. At the start of every year there is the spike in gym memberships of people who want to lose weight.  We have all heard the phrase **calories in, calories out**. If you spend time at the gym burning more calories that you eat you will lose weight.

However this is not how the body works, studies have shown that **exercise does not cause weight loss**.

In fact energy expenditure actually plateaus, meaning the at after a certain amount of exercise, you don't keep burning calories at the same rate.
Our body sets a limit to how much energy it is willing to expend

However this does not mean that exercise does not contribute to weight loss, in addition exercise has many other benefits that are arguably a lot better than weight loss

- **Improves cognitive function**
	- When you exercise neurons in our brain fire more to control movement, coordination and balance, Due to this higher activity neurons which are brain cells get the signal to produce more of the [[BDNF]] protein, 
	- Exercise promotes the release of lactate, a [[myokine]] produced in skeletal muscle. Lactate enters the bloodstream and then crosses the blood-brain barrier, promoting [[BDNF]] production.

	- Lactate and BDNF: Since **lactate** is crucial in elevating [[BDNF]] (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor) levels, high-intensity interval training (HIIT) notably boosts [[BDNF]] more than moderate continuous exercise.
		- **Protocol**: HIIT exercise consisting of six 40-second intervals at 100 percent of VO2​ peak increased BDNF 4 to 5 times more than prolonged exercise (90 minutes at 25 percent VO2​ peak).
- Improves mental health, alleviates stress, depression and anxiety
	- Stimulates the release of norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine.
- During exercise, contracting muscles release signaling molecules called [[myokines]].
	- During exercise when the muslces contract it release signaling molecules called **myokines** 
- Increase metabolic efficiency.
	- Decrease insulin resistance and increase sensitivity, the body can easily switch to fat oxidation ( burning fat for fuel)
	- Muscles can decrease insulin resistance, this allows more glucose to enter your cells keeping blood sugar low. We only need a little bit of insulin for our cells to start to let glucose in,
		- People with high insulin resistance require a lot of insulin in order for cells to come in, [[Are you too Fat or just Too weak?]]
