**Human behavior and decisions are heavily influenced by biology**
- Wheat farmers are more likely to walk around obstacles than rice farmers. **Deeply ingrained ancestral cultural practices can influence individual approaches.** 03:24 
- Depending on the stage women are in their menstrual cycle they have differences in what men they prefer 08:11 

**Premenstrual changes, brain tumors, glucose fluctuations, anabolic steroids**
These are all reasons used in a courtroom to mitigate violent crimes 10:14 

Physiological states can influence brain function and behavior 12:42 
Thought, memory and emotion can affect your physiological body. 12:50   
Behaviors **influences** can be traced backwards in time starting from : 32:07 

1\. recent neural events
- **immediate** response from limbic system
- sensory physiology such as hunger 
- hormone levels from days ago, such as high stress (cortisol) throughout the **week**
- developmental experiences from **years** or months ago (PTSD)

2\. environment during lifetimes such as 
- **adolescence** which impacts prefrontal cortex development
- **childhood** which impacts brain construction
- **fetal** life and fetal brain programing
- at **conception** which impacts your genes
3\. evolutionary pressure
- ancestral culture
- evolution which impact species specific behaviors  

**Human behavior challenges**
**Humans are are exactly like other species **
- Symmetry is an attractive, across monkeys and fishing is similar across species
**Humans have the same or similar biological mechanism as other species but use it in a unique way** 50:00 
-  A drone operator sitting in an safe air conditioned room, who can kill people they don't even know miles away, activates the same physiological state as a baboon chasing and killing it prey  
**Humans do things that no other species do **51:30   
- No other species have non-reproductive sex day and day out.
