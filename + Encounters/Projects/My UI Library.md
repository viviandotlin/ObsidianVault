how to market this?

have a tiered system like the makeitaniatmed.dev where you increase the price based on how many components. you have

Create a newsletter
In the new letter you can give them the code this week
If they want to buy the whole repo then pay in tiers 


clone origin app

create a newsletter everyweek sending out your components for only that week, 
if that want the whole library they subscribe

twitter post your work each page you create post it
(makeitaniamted.dev) 3k
(uiiindev) 10k
this year get 500 followers

[Open Source Alternatives to Popular Software](https://openalternative.co/)


just call each one screen-01 ... screen-02
add tags to the screen
on the UI you can group them by tags

patterns 
do it like this for now and see if any issues come up?


**principles**
After you are done using the variables
Ask it to update using the closes tailwind values

It is easier to get the working version and convert into your UI
Instead of building your UI and getting the working version applied on top. Of it

I think you should just start copying UI, do this half and half is just confusing
